Style Guidelines SEG group 14

Overall look and feel: 
    Our goal is to motivate and energize the user. 
    We will have a simple aestetic but also bold to captue attention. 

Colours: 
    After some reseaarch, we found that the most motivating and energizing color is yellow. 
    Colours that go well with yellow are blue, gray and black. 
    We found this nice colour palette that includes these colours:
    #080808 #F7D624 #FBC702 #D5CABB #308EAB

Fonts: 
    A nice and aesthetic font is 'Candara'. 
    A bonus to this font is that it is web safe.
    We also chose it sans-serif.

Links: 
    Our links will not have an underline but they will change colour or 
    become bold when the user hovers over it.

Buttons:
    Our buttons will be rectangular with rounded edges.
    They will become darker, change colour or gain a shadow when the user hovers over them.
